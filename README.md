# deep-learning-from-scratch
Deep Learning from Scratch  This project implements a neural network in Python from scratch, using the MNIST dataset to classify images of the digit '5'. It includes custom functions for forward propagation, cost computation, and backpropagation. Visualizations of training metrics are provided, along with a comprehensive report and dataset details.
